This repo is a simple demonstration of how aws lambda can act as a worker service.

Data Work Flow:
Users upload images from a react user interface to an express api server using FormData. 
An api route of the api server would handle the requests with FormData, and upload images to AWS s3. 
GenerateThumbnail lambda function would be triggered if any images are uploaded to s3, generating a thumbnail and uplaoding the output to s3.
